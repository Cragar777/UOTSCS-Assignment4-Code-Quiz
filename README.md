# UOTSCS-Assignment4-Code-Quiz

Code Quiz Challenge

This application allows a user to test their knowledge of JavaScript by taking a timed quiz. The quiz will begin upon the user clicking the "Start Quiz" button. The user will be presented with the first question and 4 possible answers. The timer will begin at the same time. After an answer is chosen the next question will be displayed. A message showing Correct! or Wrong! is displayed indicating the result of the last question. If the answer was wrong the timer is reduced by 15 seconds. At the end of the questions or the timer timeout, whichever comes first, a screen indicating the quiz id done is displayed. An entry prompt allows the user to input their initials and their score is saved.
